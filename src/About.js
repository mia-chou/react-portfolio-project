            I'm a freelance frontend developer based in West Yorkshire, Leeds,
            holding a Masters degree in Communication and Media. About a year
            ago, I started learning to code because I wanted to understand how
            my web app projects worked behind the scenes. While I was good at
            designing websites and media using design software, I wanted to dive
            into coding to build and improve my projects. I bring a strong skill
            set in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            responsive design. I love learning new things, especially about new
            software and automation technology, and I thrive in collaborative
            environments and welcome fresh and innovative challenges to create a
            positive influence in the digital world.
            <br />
            <br />
            How did I get here? I began experimenting with basic HTML and CSS
            during my time at university; however, I knew that I wanted to take
            my passion further, and that's when I started a coding course called
            SheCodes.
