          As a freelance Front-End developer based in West Yorkshire, Leeds, I hold a Masters degree in Communication and Media. Approximately a year ago, I began learning to code, motivated by a curiosity to understand the details of my web app projects. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Python, and responsive design, I have a strong skill set in web development. Eager to explore new software and automation technology, I excel in teamwork and welcome new and creative challenges to make a positive difference in the online world.
