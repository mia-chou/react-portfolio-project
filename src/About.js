            I'm a freelance frontend developer based in West Yorkshire, Leeds, holding a Masters degree in Communication and Media. About a year ago, I started learning to code because I wanted to understand how my web app projects worked behind the scenes. While I was good at designing websites and media using design software, I wanted to dive into coding to build and improve my projects. I bring a strong skill set in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. I love learning new things, especially about new software and automation technology, and I thrive in collaborative environments and welcome fresh and innovative challenges to create a positive influence in the digital world.
            <br />
            How did I reach this stage? I started playing around with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while working. But I wanted to explore my interest more, so I joined a coding course called SheCodes.
